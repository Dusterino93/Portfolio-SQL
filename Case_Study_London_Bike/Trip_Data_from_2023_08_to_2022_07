# Using the 2022 August Trip Data as a foundation, fill in missing data from other tables (if it exists). We'll use this table to fill in the gaps for all the other tables once it's completed. 
# Problem: some stations share the same latitudinal and longitudinal data despite being different stations. So due to this ambiguity, our best bet is to remove any data with NULL values.

# Cleaning 2022 August Trip Data
# First we'll get only the information we need. We'll start by separating time and date from "started by" and "ended by" values. Then we'll filter out the "NULL" values for longitudinal and latitudinal dat and 
#keep the rest of the columns. We'll also create a new column called "trip_duration" that records the length of the trip.

# We save this into a new table "Cleaned_2022_08_Trip_Data"
# Then we repeat the same cleaning procedure for 2022 September to 2023 July
# Then using the cleaned 2022 August trip data as a base, we join in other tables to fill in any missing values.
